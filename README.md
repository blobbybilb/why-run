Archived... probably permanently unless I get a good (or seemingly good for the first 10 mins) idea of what to do with it. It was mostly a joke. The "-" to make a task async might be nice, might make that a separate command (dash-to-background was an idea for the name). 

This might not be in a working state anyway. Just use a shell script or two.
